The first step to implementing a game on Unreal Engine is installing the engine.
Next we would need to import assets, which in this case are the image files for the ghosts and  Vaxman.
The imported files can be editted and modified as desired.
We then go on to create the player and actors, in our case, Vaxman and the ghosts respectively.
Next we attach a camera and determine the angle of capture.
We next create a game mode, determining the spawning point of the actors.
Using the world settings, we determine how the world looks like.
Determination of inputs comes next, we attach actions to specific keys or buttons depending on what control/input device is being used.
An equivalent of the ontimer in pygame is the Event tick in Unreal Engine, We use the Event tick to set the speed of events in the game.
The Destroy Actor node can be created to make the ghosts disappear each time a ghost collides with Vaxman.
Audio can be inserted based on different animations.
